# Project Rewrite

## Story

This kind of exercise is a classic: your task is to reimplement some basic built-in functionalities of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using built-in functionalities or the standard library itself. Caveat: donâ€™t use such code in production!

## What you gonna learn?

You will practice the basics of the language while getting familiar with a few simple algorithms.

## Tasks

1. Implement the `min(x, y)` function for two real numbers as inputs!
2. Implement the `max(x, y)` function for two real numbers as inputs!
3. Implement the `len(iterable)` function for an iterable input which returns the length of the iterable!
4. Implement the `multiply(x, y)` function for integer numbers as inputs! Do not use the `*`, `/`, and `//` operators and any built-in functions, but you may (and should) use `+`.
5. Implement the `pow(x, y)` function for real base numbers and positive integer exponents! Do not use the `**` operator and any built-in functions! Here you can use `*`.
6. [EXTRA] Implement the `divmod(x, y)` function for for two integer numbers as inputs! Do not use the `//` and the `%` operators and any built-in functions! It should return a tuple: the first value should be equal to the value of `x // y` and the second equal to the value of `x % y`! Do not use the `//` operator and any built-in functions!

## Acceptance criteria

- [1.1] MANDATORY! For any two real numbers the less is returned
- [1.2] MANDATORY! No built-in functions are used
- [2.1] MANDATORY! For any two real numbers the greater is returned
- [2.2] MANDATORY! No built-in functions are used
- [3.1] MANDATORY! For any iterable the count of the elements is returned
- [3.2] MANDATORY! No built-in functions are used
- [4.1] For any two integer inputs the returned value equals the result of `x * y`
- [4.2] MANDATORY! Neither `*`, `/`, `//` nor any built-in functions are used
- [5.1] For inputs from the specified domain the returned value equals the result of `x**y`
- [5.2] MANDATORY! Neither `**` nor any built-in functions are used
- [6.1] For any two positive integer inputs the returned value equals `(x // y, x % y)`
- [6.2] For any two +/- integer inputs the returned value equals `(x // y, x % y)`
- [6.3] MANDATORY! Neither `//` nor any built-in functions are used

## Technical requirements

In general, do not use any built-in functions!

## Hints

- How to look for an extreme (min or max) value in a collection?
  Iterate through it and keep track of a temporary least and greatest
  value and compare it at every iteration with the actual element.
  At the end of the loop it will hold the answer.
- To get a length, you can iterate and count.
- Integer multiplication is basicly addition for a given number of times.
- An integer power function is basicly multiplication for a given number of times.
- How can you divide and calulate modulo _without_ actually dividing?
  Try to add up numbers until you reach the goal! We'll test only with
  not too large numbers (between `-100` and `100`).
  Also, reproducing integer division can be tricky; as you can read in the
  [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex),
  "The result is always rounded towards minus infinity:
  `1//2` is `0`, `(-1)//2` is `-1`, `1//(-2)` is `-1`, and `(-1)//(-2)` is `0`."
